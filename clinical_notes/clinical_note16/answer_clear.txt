Based on the patient's history of COPD and symptoms of increased shortness of breath and coughing, especially with exertion, in the years leading up to the diagnosis of heart failure in 1984, it is possible that earlier recognition and management of the exacerbation of COPD could have potentially prevented or delayed the development of heart failure. Monitoring closely for signs of respiratory distress, considering cardiology consults for further management, and addressing any contributing factors such as smoking could have been beneficial in preventing the progression to heart failure.
