The patient's heart failure in 1984 may have been preventable if earlier signs of mild cardiac dysfunction identified in 1984 had been addressed promptly. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and response to treatment could have guided earlier interventions to manage the patient's cardiac dysfunction and prevent further deterioration. Additionally, addressing the patient's non-adherence to inhalers and optimizing his COPD management could have potentially mitigated the progression of his heart failure. Early recognition and intervention based on objective data and symptoms could have played a crucial role in preventing the development of heart failure in this patient.
