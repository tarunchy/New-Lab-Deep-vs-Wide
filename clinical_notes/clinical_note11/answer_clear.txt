Based on the patient's subjective reports of increased fatigue, thirst, and urination in 1983 and 1982, there were early signs of uncontrolled diabetes and possible complications of congestive heart failure (CHF). These symptoms could have indicated the need for closer monitoring and aggressive management of his diabetes and hypertension to prevent further end-organ damage, including heart failure. Addressing these symptoms and risk factors earlier may have helped prevent or delay the onset of heart failure in 1984.
