### Assessment  (≈200-250 words)
The patient is a middle-aged male with poorly controlled type-2 diabetes and hypertension. His symptoms of fatigue, polyuria, and polydipsia are consistent with uncontrolled diabetes. The elevated HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels confirm the need for optimization of his diabetes management. Additionally, his elevated LDL cholesterol and microalbuminuria indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal complications. Lifestyle modifications and medication adjustments are warranted to reduce his risk factors and improve his overall health outcomes.

### Plan  (≈200-250 words)
The plan includes intensifying the patient's diabetes management with adjustments to his oral hypoglycemic agents and initiation of a statin for dyslipidemia. Blood pressure control will be optimized with medication titration and lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and increased physical activity. The patient will be referred to a dietitian for personalized dietary counseling and a diabetes educator for self-management education.
