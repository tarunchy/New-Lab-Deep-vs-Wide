As a medical assistant, I would need to review the patient's medical records from previous years to determine if there were any signs or symptoms of heart failure that could have been identified and addressed earlier. By examining the patient's history of type-2 diabetes and hypertension, both of which are risk factors for heart failure, I would look for any indications of worsening cardiac function or other related issues that may have been present in the years leading up to 1984. This information would help determine if the patient's heart failure in 1984 could have potentially been prevented with earlier intervention and management of their underlying conditions.
