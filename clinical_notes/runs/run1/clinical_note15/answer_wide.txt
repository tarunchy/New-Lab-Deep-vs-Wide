The patient's heart failure in 1984 might have been mitigated or its progression slowed if earlier signs of cardiac involvement had been addressed more aggressively. In 1971, the ECG showed evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, which was suggestive of cardiac strain, possibly due to chronic hypoxemia and increased pulmonary pressures from COPD. However, no further cardiac workup was ordered at that time. Additionally, in 1979, an echocardiogram revealed early systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45%, indicating compromised cardiac function. If these findings had prompted earlier intervention, such as optimizing cardiovascular risk factors, initiating appropriate cardiac medications, and more intensive monitoring, it might have helped in delaying or preventing the severe left ventricular dysfunction observed in 1984. Furthermore, consistent management of COPD exacerbations and ensuring optimal oxygenation could have reduced cardiac stress, potentially preventing the exacerbation of heart failure.
