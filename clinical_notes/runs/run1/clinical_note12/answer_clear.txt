The patient's symptoms of increased shortness of breath with exertion over the years may have been indicative of worsening lung function and underlying cardiovascular strain, highlighting the importance of proactive monitoring and treatment to prevent the progression of comorbid conditions such as heart failure. Regular follow-up, adherence to medication regimens, smoking cessation, and lifestyle modifications could have played a crucial role in mitigating the risk of heart failure in this patient.
