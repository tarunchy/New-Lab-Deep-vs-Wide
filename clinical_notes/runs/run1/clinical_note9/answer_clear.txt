Based on the patient's subjective reports of increased fatigue, thirst, and urination in 1983, there were early signs of potential complications related to his poorly controlled type-2 diabetes and hypertension. Close monitoring of blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and cardiac function could have provided valuable insights into the progression of his conditions and allowed for timely intervention to prevent the development of heart failure in 1984. Early recognition and management of these warning signs could have potentially mitigated the risk of heart failure and improved the patient's overall health outcomes.
