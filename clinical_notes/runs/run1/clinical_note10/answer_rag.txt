Based on the patient's history of poorly controlled type-2 diabetes and hypertension dating back to at least 1980, it is possible that earlier signs of cardiovascular issues were present but not adequately addressed. The patient's non-compliance with diet and exercise likely contributed to his uncontrolled blood glucose levels and obesity, increasing his risk for cardiovascular complications. The elevated LDL cholesterol levels noted in the assessment also indicate a potential risk factor for heart failure. Therefore, with better management of his diabetes, hypertension, and overall cardiovascular health earlier on, it is possible that the patient's heart failure in 1984 could have been prevented or at least mitigated.
