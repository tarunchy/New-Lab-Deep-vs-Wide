Based on the patient's subjective reports of increased fatigue, frequent urination, and blurry vision in 1986, there were potential early signs of uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension that could have contributed to the development of heart failure in 1984. Close monitoring of these symptoms and prompt intervention to optimize the management of diabetes and hypertension may have helped prevent or delay the onset of heart failure in this complex patient.
