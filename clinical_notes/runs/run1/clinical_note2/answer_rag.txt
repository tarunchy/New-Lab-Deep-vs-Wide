Based on the patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, and early signs of renal involvement, there were potential indicators of cardiovascular risk that could have been addressed earlier to potentially prevent the development of heart failure in 2022. Monitoring and managing these risk factors more closely, such as optimizing blood pressure control, glycemic control, and renal function, could have potentially mitigated the progression to congestive heart failure. Additionally, lifestyle modifications and early intervention with guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure could have been implemented sooner to prevent or delay the onset of heart failure exacerbation.
