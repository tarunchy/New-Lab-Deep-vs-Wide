Based on the patient's history of diabetes and hypertension, as well as the symptoms of fatigue and occasional dizziness reported in previous years, there were potential warning signs that could have indicated the development of heart failure. Early detection and management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as optimizing blood pressure control and monitoring for signs of heart failure, could have potentially prevented the exacerbation of heart failure in 2022. Regular cardiac evaluations and proactive measures to address underlying heart disease may have been beneficial in preventing the progression of heart failure in this patient.
