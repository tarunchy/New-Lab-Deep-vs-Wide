As a medical assistant, I would review the patient's medical history from previous years to assess if there were any signs or symptoms of heart failure that could have been identified and addressed earlier. By examining the patient's records from 1980 to 1983, I would look for any indications of worsening hypertension or diabetes control, as these are risk factors for heart failure. Additionally, I would check if the patient had any previous cardiac evaluations or tests that may have shown early signs of heart dysfunction. Based on this information, I would determine if there were missed opportunities for intervention that could have potentially prevented the heart failure in 1984.
