As a medical assistant, I would review the patient's medical records from previous years to look for any signs or symptoms that could have indicated the development of heart failure in 1984. By examining the patient's history of COPD and smoking, as well as any other relevant medical information, I would assess whether there were any warning signs that could have been identified and addressed earlier to potentially prevent the onset of heart failure in 1984.
