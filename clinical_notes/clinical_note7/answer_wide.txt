The patient's heart failure in 1984 might have been preventable if earlier signs of cardiovascular strain had been addressed more proactively. In 1971, the patient exhibited signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on ECG, which suggested long-standing cardiovascular strain likely exacerbated by his underlying lung disease. This finding, coupled with chronic hypoxia from COPD, could have been an early indicator of potential heart failure risk. If these signs had prompted more aggressive management of both his COPD and cardiovascular health, such as optimizing oxygen therapy, controlling blood pressure, and implementing lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation, it might have mitigated the progression to heart failure. Additionally, regular cardiovascular monitoring and early intervention with cardioprotective medications could have further reduced the risk of developing heart failure.
