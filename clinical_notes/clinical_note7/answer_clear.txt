Based on the patient's history of COPD and former smoking, it is possible that earlier signs of heart failure may have been present but not adequately addressed, leading to the exacerbation in 1984. Close monitoring of the patient's symptoms, vital signs, and response to treatment over the years could have potentially identified early signs of heart failure, such as elevated blood pressure or signs of right heart strain, allowing for earlier intervention and prevention of the exacerbation in 1984. Additionally, addressing the patient's non-compliance with oxygen therapy and inhaler therapy could have potentially mitigated the progression of his COPD and its impact on his cardiovascular health, potentially preventing the exacerbation of heart failure in 1984.
