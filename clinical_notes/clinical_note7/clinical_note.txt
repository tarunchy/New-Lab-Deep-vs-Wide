### Assessment  (≈200-250 words)
The patient presents with an acute exacerbation of COPD characterized by increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production. His symptoms are indicative of worsening airflow limitation and impaired gas exchange. The elevated inflammatory markers suggest an infectious etiology contributing to the exacerbation. The arterial blood gas findings reveal respiratory failure with hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests support the diagnosis of severe COPD exacerbation.

### Plan  (≈200-250 words)
The patient will be started on bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics to manage the exacerbation. Oxygen therapy will be initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above {{90%}}. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and response to treatment is essential. Respiratory therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation will be initiated to improve lung function and exercise tolerance. Smoking cessation counseling will be provided to prevent further exacerbations. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess response to treatment and adjust the management plan accordingly.
