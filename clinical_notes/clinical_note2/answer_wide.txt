The patient's heart failure in 2022 might have been preventable with more aggressive management of his diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular risk factors in the preceding years. Throughout the years, the patient consistently exhibited signs of uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as evidenced by elevated HbA1c levels, suboptimal blood pressure control, and elevated LDL cholesterol levels. These factors are known contributors to cardiovascular disease and heart failure. Earlier and more aggressive interventions, such as optimizing glycemic control with insulin therapy, intensifying antihypertensive treatment, and ensuring strict adherence to lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, could have potentially mitigated the progression of cardiovascular complications. Additionally, regular monitoring and management of early signs of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, along with timely referrals to specialists, might have helped in preventing the development of heart failure.
