The patient's heart failure in 2022 may have been preventable based on earlier signs such as increased fatigue, occasional dizziness, and symptoms of heart failure exacerbation noted in previous years. By closely monitoring and optimizing his heart failure medications, including increasing his lisinopril dose and considering the addition of a beta-blocker as recommended in 2023, early intervention and management of his cardiovascular risk factors could have potentially prevented the progression to heart failure exacerbation in 2022. Regular cardiac evaluations and proactive treatment adjustments based on subjective reports and objective findings could have played a crucial role in preventing or delaying the onset of heart failure in this patient.
