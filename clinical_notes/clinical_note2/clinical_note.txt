His elevated fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels confirm poor glycemic control. We will increase his dose of metformin to 1500mg twice daily and recommend dietary modifications to help improve his blood sugar levels. We will also refer him to a diabetic educator for further education on managing his diabetes.

In addition, Mr. Doe's lipid panel shows elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels, which puts him at risk for cardiovascular disease. We will recommend lifestyle modifications, including a heart-healthy diet and regular exercise. We will also consider starting him on a statin medication to help lower his cholesterol levels.

Mr. Doe's blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg is elevated, indicating poor control of his hypertension. We will increase his lisinopril dose to 40mg daily and recommend lifestyle modifications, including reducing sodium intake and increasing physical activity. We will also monitor his blood pressure closely and consider adding a second antihypertensive medication if needed.

Follow-Up:
Mr. Doe will follow up in 2 weeks for a repeat fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c level check. He will also follow up with a diabetic educator for further education on managing his diabetes. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to assess his response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments to his medications.

  - eGFR: >60 mL/min/1.73m²
  - Liver enzymes within normal limits

Assessment and Plan:
Mr. Doe's elevated blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c indicate poor glycemic control despite his current medication regimen. Given his symptoms of fatigue, frequent urination, and blurry vision, it is likely that his diabetes is contributing to these symptoms. We will need to intensify his diabetes management to achieve better glycemic control and prevent further complications.

1. Diabetes Management:
- Increase metformin to 1500mg twice daily
- Add insulin glargine 10 units at bedtime for better glycemic control
- Refer to a certified diabetes educator for education on insulin administration and monitoring

2. Hypertension Management:
- Continue lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure control
- Monitor blood pressure at home and follow up in 2 weeks for reevaluation

3. Diabetic Retinopathy:
- Refer to ophthalmology for further evaluation and management of diabetic retinopathy

4. Lifestyle Modifications:
- Encourage regular physical activity and weight management
- Refer to a dietitian for dietary counseling

5. Follow-Up:
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess response to treatment and adjust management as needed

Mr. Doe was counseled on the importance of adherence to his medication regimen, monitoring his blood glucose levels regularly, and seeking medical attention for any concerning symptoms. He was provided with a glucometer and instructed on how to use it to monitor his blood sugar levels at home.

In conclusion, Mr. Doe's current presentation highlights the importance of close monitoring and management of his diabetes to prevent complications and improve his quality of life. By intensifying his diabetes management and addressing his hypertension, we aim to achieve better glycemic control and reduce his risk of long-term complications. We will continue to work closely with Mr. Doe to optimize his treatment plan and provide ongoing support for his chronic conditions.

Mr. Doe presents with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and lower extremity edema. Given his history of diabetes and hypertension, the differential diagnosis includes heart failure exacerbation, diabetic nephropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.

1. Heart Failure Exacerbation:
- Given Mr. Doe's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and lower extremity edema, heart failure exacerbation is a leading consideration. We will initiate treatment with diuretics to reduce fluid overload and improve symptoms. We will also optimize his heart failure medications, including increasing his lisinopril dose and considering the addition of a beta-blocker.

2. Diabetic Nephropathy:
- Given Mr. Doe's history of diabetes and elevated creatinine, we will monitor his renal function closely. We will ensure he is on appropriate renoprotective medications, such as an ACE inhibitor, to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

3. Peripheral Vascular Disease:
- Given Mr. Doe's lower extremity edema, we will assess for peripheral vascular disease with a lower extremity Doppler ultrasound. We will also encourage lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation and regular exercise, to improve his vascular health.

4. Diabetes Management:
- Mr. Doe's hemoglobin A1c is above target, indicating suboptimal diabetes control. We will intensify his diabetes management by considering the addition of a second-line agent, such as a sulfonylurea or a GLP-1 agonist. We will also reinforce the importance of diet and exercise in diabetes management.

5. Hypertension Management:
- Mr. Doe's blood pressure is elevated, indicating suboptimal hypertension control. We will consider titrating his amlodipine dose or adding a second antihypertensive agent to achieve better blood pressure control.

Follow-Up:
Mr. Doe will follow up in 2 weeks for a repeat assessment of his symptoms, blood pressure, and renal function. He will also undergo a lower extremity Doppler ultrasound to evaluate for peripheral vascular disease. We will continue to optimize his medications and provide education on lifestyle modifications to improve his overall health.
